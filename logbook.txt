[6/10/2021 8:13:43 AM] The idea of extending the notion of popularity to encompass a cronological component comes from the need to acknowledge that 'preference for music' (or musical taste elsewhere) changes in predictable ways as we age (with clear differential effects of gender) [1][2][3][4]; this regularity can be explored in recommendation research.

[6/13/2021 10:53:01 AM] In P01/simulate.py, the simulated user study is predicated on a "surprise threshold", which is an idealised construct that corresponds to the degree of surprise above which:
  (1) longer explanations are systematically preferred by participants, or
  (2) participants systematically explore a larger share of additional information (motivation)

  This script aims to estimate that threshold using datasets collected from the Spotify platform. The process is itself predicated on a number of conventions, premises and assumptions, which we make explicit in the following:

  -----------
  Conventions
  -----------  
  C1. Adopt a definition of `popularity` advanced by many authors [1][2] as a convention;
  C2. Adopt a definition of `surprise`   advanced by Kaminskas and Bridge [3] as a convention;
  C3. Adopt the definition of `relevant feature` from Tversky [4] as a convention. This definition describes how items are compared according to their features.

  -----------
  Premises 
  -----------
  {testable}
  (From now on, the term 'item' refers to a music track served by the Spotify streaming platform)

  P3. Assume that every user has at least one highly popular item in their profile;

  -----------
  Assumptions
  -----------
  A0. Owing to individual differences, high variability of the behaviour of interest is expected.
      -- This means there is no hope for useful regularity at low cost in the individual level;
      -- Thus, we focus on seeking useful regularity in the population-level;
  A1. Assume that the available item features are relevant to the population of users [C3];
  A2. Assume that the set of items that are highly popular in a given period of time are highly
      similar (among themselves) than if compared to less-popular items [C1][C3][5];
  A3. Assume that we have a representative sample of top N most popular items in a target region
      (e.g., Brazil) nowadays;


  Rationale
  A1. From [P1] and [P2], we conclude that there is a region in item space within which most of
      the popular items are confined {testable; assess average pop(i) for i interior/exterior to hull};
